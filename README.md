# Notes on Economics Involving Calculus

These notes are not complete by any means, but feel free to read through them. UCSB has a course on intermediate economics (ECON 10A) and many people struggle with the class. I will attempt to update the notes as time allows. If you find any errors, please feel free to let me know.
